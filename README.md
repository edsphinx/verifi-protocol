# VeriFi Protocol: The On-Chain Oracle

> **Transform on-chain data into tradable markets. No external oracles. Pure blockchain truth.**

VeriFi is a decentralized derivatives protocol that empowers anyone to create prediction markets on verifiable, on-chain events‚Äîdirectly on the Aptos blockchain, without external oracles.

---

##  The Vision

Imagine a financial ecosystem where **any on-chain truth** can become a liquid, tradable market. Where creating financial instruments isn't restricted to experts, but open to the entire community. That's VeriFi Protocol.

##  The Problem

Current prediction markets face two critical barriers:

1. **Insecure Oracle Reliance**: External oracles create single points of failure
2. **Complex Market Creation**: Technical barriers exclude non-developers and silence community insights

These limitations prevent Aptos from realizing its vision of trustless, frictionless value movement.

##  Our Solution

VeriFi solves both problems with:

###  Oracle-less Architecture
Markets resolve **100% programmatically** by directly querying other Aptos contracts. Check a protocol's TVL, a DAO proposal's outcome, or any on-chain metric‚Äîwithout external dependencies.

###  AI-Powered Market Creation
Our intelligent dashboard makes market creation trivial:
1. **Natural Language Input**: Describe your market in plain English
2. **AI Validation**: Claude analyzes feasibility and suggests improvements
3. **Smart Extraction**: AI fills parameters (protocol, metric, conditions, dates)
4. **One-Click Deploy**: Template engine handles all contract complexity

Example: "Will Circle USDC total supply exceed 5M by March 15th?" ‚Üí Fully configured market in seconds.

###  The "Market Creator" Economy
Every user can become a market creator, monetizing their ecosystem insights and knowledge.

    I --> J[Treasury Management]
    B --> K[Supabase DB]

```

### Smart Contracts (Move)
- **Market Factory**: Creates isolated market objects with resource accounts
- **Oracle Registry**: Whitelists and manages on-chain data sources
- **Trading Engine**: Primary issuance (1 APT = 1 YES + 1 NO)
- **Resolution Module**: Programmatic settlement via on-chain queries

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15 + React 19**: Modern, performant UI
- **Aptos Wallet Adapter**: Universal wallet support
- **Supabase**: Real-time event indexing
- **shadcn/ui**: Beautiful, accessible components

### Key Innovations
1. **Resource Account Architecture**: Each market has isolated treasury
2. **Template Engine**: Maps UI selections to contract calls
3. **Hybrid Trading**: Primary issuance + AMM pools (Tapp.Exchange integration ready)
4. **Real-time Indexing**: Direct blockchain event monitoring

##  What We've Built

###  Core Features
- [x] Oracle-less market creation and resolution
- [x] AI-powered market creation with natural language input
- [x] Buy/sell YES/NO outcome tokens
- [x] Portfolio tracking with P&L
- [x] AMM pools with liquidity provision (Tapp integration)
- [x] Swap YES/NO tokens with real-time price impact
- [x] Liquidity positions dashboard with PnL tracking
- [x] Transaction explorer links for on-chain verification
- [x] Real-time notifications with clickable transaction links
- [x] Admin control panel
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (90%+ coverage)

###  Supported Oracles
- **Aptos Balance Oracle**: Track any account's APT holdings
- **USDC Total Supply**: Monitor USDC circulation
- **Extensible**: Add custom oracles via registry

###  Tapp.Exchange AMM Integration

**VeriFi is the first prediction market to implement a custom Tapp hook + integrated AMM UI**

We've developed a complete AMM solution for YES/NO token trading:

####  Smart Contract Hook (`tapp_prediction_hook.move`)
-  **Full Hook Interface**: Implements create_pool, add_liquidity, remove_liquidity, swap, collect_fee
-  **Dynamic Fees**: 0.3% base fee, 0.5% during high volatility (< 1h to resolution)
-  **Auto-disable Trading**: Pools stop trading when market resolves
-  **NFT-based Positions**: Liquidity providers receive Tapp position NFTs
-  **Local Tests**: Integration tested with 6/7 steps successful

####  Integrated AMM UI (Production Ready)
-  **Pool Creation**: One-click pool deployment from market page
-  **Add Liquidity**: Deposit YES/NO tokens, receive LP tokens with position NFTs
-  **Swap Interface**: Trade tokens with live price impact preview
-  **Liquidity Dashboard**: View positions with real-time PnL calculations
-  **Transaction Links**: Direct links to Aptos Explorer for verification
-  **React Query Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI updates after transactions

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **UI/Frontend**: Fully functional on testnet with complete AMM flow
- ‚è≥ **Hook Deployment**: Submitted for review with Tapp team per [official process](https://github.com/tapp-exchange/hook-documentation#submission-process)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Composability**: YES/NO tokens tradable on any Tapp-compatible DEX
- **Liquidity**: LPs earn fees on both outcome sides
- **Best UX**: Seamless integration directly in market pages
- **Innovation**: First hook to bring prediction markets to Tapp ecosystem
