VeriFi is a groundbreaking decentralized derivatives protocol that empowers anyone to create and trade prediction markets on verifiable, on-chain events—directly on the Aptos blockchain. By eliminating external oracle dependencies, we've built the most trustless prediction market platform in DeFi.

## 🚀 The Vision
Imagine a financial ecosystem where any on-chain truth can become a liquid, tradable market. Where the creation of financial instruments isn't restricted to experts, but is open to the entire community through a simple, guided experience. That is the vision of VeriFi Protocol.

## ⛓️ The Problem
DeFi's potential is limited by its reliance on insecure oracles and a market creation process so complex it excludes non-developers, silencing the valuable insights of the broader community. This creates two critical barriers: a single point of failure and a bottleneck for innovation.

## ✨ Our Solution
VeriFi solves these problems with an elegant architecture and a radically simple user experience. We have built a protocol that allows markets to be resolved 100% programmatically and trustlessly by directly querying the state of other contracts on Aptos. Zero external dependencies.

## 🎯 What We've Built

We've delivered a **production-ready platform** that showcases the future of decentralized prediction markets:

### Core Protocol
* ✅ **100% Trustless Resolution:** Markets resolve programmatically by querying on-chain data directly—no oracles, no centralized resolvers
* ✅ **Guided Market Creation:** Intuitive UI that transforms complex derivatives into a 3-click experience
* ✅ **Secure Treasury Management:** Resource account-based architecture ensures funds are isolated and secure per market
* ✅ **Real-time Event Indexing:** Nodit-powered webhooks deliver instant updates and notifications

### Advanced Trading Features
* ✅ **Hybrid AMM System:** Integrated Tapp.Exchange for swap-based trading with hooks for prediction markets
* ✅ **Dual Trading Modes:** Primary issuance (1 APT → 1 YES + 1 NO) + AMM pools for secondary trading
* ✅ **Custom Trading Hooks:** Prediction-market-aware liquidity pools with specialized logic
* ✅ **Portfolio Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of positions, P&L, and trading history

### Developer Experience
* ✅ **Comprehensive Testing Suite:** Full E2E tests, oracle integration tests, and Move unit tests
* ✅ **Auto-generated ABIs:** TypeScript definitions generated automatically from deployed contracts
* ✅ **Admin Dashboard:** Monitor protocol health, deployed modules, and system status
* ✅ **Notification System:** Global and user-specific notifications for market events
